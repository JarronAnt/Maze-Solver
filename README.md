# Maze-Solver

This maze solver uses a BFS algorithim to find the path

I shall try to explain the steps involved in solving the maze

1) we load the maze as a black and white image
2) we check for the start and end points set by the mouse click
3)we use BFS to color in all of the maze routes
4) we bubble up from the bottom of the maze to the start point as that is the only continous route
5) we recolor the acutal path to be whie
